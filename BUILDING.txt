See:

packageWindowsVersion.py
packageMacVersion.py
and
createMacBundle.py
- MyData's "setup.py" file for py2app, called by "packageMacVersion.py".

packageMacVersion.py currently builds a DMG allowing the MyData.app bundle to be
dragged and dropped into the /Applications folder.  However this isn't suitable
for installing things outside of the /Applications folder, e.g. a Launch daemon
in /Library/LaunchDaemons/, so a new installation method for Mac OS X is being
investigated.  After building the app bundle with
"python createMacBundle.py pyapp" (which should create "dist/MyData.app"), a PKG 
installer (archived in a DMG) can be built by running "sh pkgscripts/makemacpkg".
