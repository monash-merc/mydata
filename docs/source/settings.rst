Settings
========

MyData's Settings dialog can be opened by clicking on the |settings| icon on
MyData's toolbar.  The Settings dialog will be automatically displayed each
time MyData is launched, unless MyData is run in "--background" mode
(which is the default for the MyData shortcut installed in the "Startup"
folder on Windows if the appropriate checkbox is ticked in MyData's setup
wizard).

General
^^^^^^^

  .. image:: images/SettingsGeneral.PNG

**Instrument Name**
  The name of the instrument (e.g. "Nikon Microscope #1") whose data
  is to be uploaded to MyTardis by this MyData instance.  If an instrument
  record with this name doesn't already exist in MyTardis within the facility
  specified below, then MyData will offer to create one (assuming that you are
  a member of a facility managers group for that facility in MyTardis).

**Facility Name**
  The name of the facility containing the instrument to upload data from.  A
  facility record must have been created by your MyTardis administrator before
  you can use MyData, and the default MyTardis username you enter below (the
  initial owner of all data uploaded by this instance) must be a member of the
  managers group for that facility.  MyData will automatically check that a
  facility record matching this facility name exists on the MyTardis server
  specified by the MyTardis URL below.  If it doesn't exist, MyData will offer
  suggestions for alternative facilities which your MyTardis account is a 
  manager of (if any).

**Contact Name**
  MyData's preferred upload method (staging) requires approval from a MyTardis
  administrator. This Contact Name will be used when sending confirmation that
  access to MyTardis's staging area has been approved for this MyData instance.

**Contact Email**
  MyData's preferred upload method (staging) requires approval from a MyTardis
  administrator. This Contact Email will be used when sending confirmation that
  access to MyTardis's staging area has been approved for this MyData instance.

**Data Directory**
  Choose a folder where you would like to store your data. e.g. D:\\Data

**MyTardis URL**
  The URL of a MyTardis server running a MyTardis version compatible with
  MyData, e.g. http://118.138.241.91/

**MyTardis Username**
  Do not put your individual MyTardis username (e.g. "jsmith") in
  here.  Because MyData is designed to be able to upload multiple users' data
  from an instrument PC, the default username used by MyData should generally
  be a facility role account, e.g. "testfacility".

**MyTardis API Key**
  API keys are similar to passwords, but they are easier to revoke and renew
  when necessary. Ask your MyTardis administrator for the API key corresponding
  to your facility role account.

Schedule
^^^^^^^^

  .. image:: images/SettingsSchedule.PNG

**Schedule type - Once**
    Run the folder scans and uploads once, on the date specified by the Date
    field and at the time specified by the Time field.

**Schedule type - Daily**
    Run the folder scans and uploads every day, at the time specified by the
    Time field.

**Schedule type - Weekly**
    Run the folder scans and uploads every week on the day(s) specified by the
    weekday checkboxes, at the time specified by the Time field.

**Schedule type - Timer**
    Run the folder scans and uploads repeatedly with an interval specified by
    the "Timer (minutes)" field between the hours of "From" and "To", every day.

**Schedule type - Manually**
    Only run the folder scans and uploads in response to user interaction -
    either clicking OK on the Settings Dialog, or clicking the Refresh icon on
    the toolbar, or clicking the "MyTardis Sync" menu item in the system tray
    menu.

**Schedule type - On startup**
    On Windows, a shortcut to MyData (configured to run in background mode)
    will be placed in the current user's Startup Items folder.  An alternative
    method of running MyData on startup, which doesn't require any user to be
    logged in, is currently in development.

**Folder Structure - Username / Dataset**
    Folders immediately inside the main data directory
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith") are assumed to be MyTardis usernames.
    Folders inside each user folder (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith\\Dataset1"
    will be mapped to MyTardis datasets.
    Datasets will be automatically grouped into MyTardis experiments according
    to the "Experiment (Dataset Grouping)" field below.

**Folder Structure - Email / Dataset**
    This folder structure works best when email addresses are unique per
    user in MyTardis.  There is no constraint requiring email addresses to be
    unique in MyTardis, but if MyTardis is using an external authentication
    provider (e.g. LDAP), there may be a requirement in the authentication
    provider making email addresses unique.
    Folders immediately inside the main data directory
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\John.Smith@example.com") are assumed to be email
    addresses which can be used to match MyTardis user accounts.  If you wish
    to use email addresses as folder names, an alternative is to use the
    "Username / Dataset" folder structure and use email addresses
    for usernames in MyTardis.  Folders inside each email folder (e.g.
    "D:\\Data\\John.Smith@example.com\\Dataset1" will be mapped to
    MyTardis datasets.  Datasets will be automatically grouped into MyTardis
    experiments according to the "Experiment (Dataset Grouping)"
    field below.

**Folder Structure - Username / Experiment / Dataset**
    Folders immediately inside the main data directory
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith") are assumed to be MyTardis usernames.
    Folders inside each user folder (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith\\Experiment1"
    will be mapped to MyTardis experiments.  Folders inside each experiment
    folder (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith\\Experiment1\\Dataset1") will be
    mapped to MyTardis datasets.

**Folder Structure - Email / Experiment / Dataset**
    This folder structure works best when email addresses are unique per
    user in MyTardis.  There is no constraint requiring email addresses to be
    unique in MyTardis, but if MyTardis is using an external authentication
    provider (e.g. LDAP), there may be a requirement in the authentication
    provider making email addresses unique.
    Folders immediately inside the main data directory
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\John.Smith@example.com") are assumed to be email
    addresses which can be used to match MyTardis user accounts.  If you wish
    to use email addresses as folder names, an alternative is to use the
    "Username / Experiment / Dataset" folder structure and use email
    addresses for usernames in MyTardis.  Folders inside each email folder (e.g.
    "D:\\Data\\John.Smith@example.com\\Experiment1" will be mapped to
    MyTardis experiments.  Folders inside each experiment folder
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\John.Smith@examples.com\\Experiment1\\Dataset1")
    will be mapped to MyTardis datasets.

**Folder Structure - Username / "MyTardis" / Experiment / Dataset**
    Folders immediately inside the main data directory
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith") are assumed to be MyTardis usernames.
    Folders inside each "MyTardis" folder
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith\\MyTardis\\Experiment1" will be mapped to
    MyTardis experiments.
    Folders inside each experiment folder
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\jsmith\\MyTardis\\Experiment1\\Dataset1") will be
    mapped to MyTardis datasets.

**Folder Structure - User Group / Instrument / Full Name / Dataset**
    Folders immediately inside the main data directory
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\SmithLab") are assumed to be MyTardis user groups.
    The actual group name in MyTardis (e.g. "TestFacility-SmithLab")
    may have a prefix (e.g. "TestFacility-") prepended to it,
    specified by the "User Group Prefix" field below.
    Each user group folder should contain exactly one folder
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\SmithLab\\Nikon Microscope #1") specifying the name
    of the instrument.  Using this scheme allows copying data from multiple
    instruments to a file share with the instrument name folder allowing users
    to distinguish between datasets from different instruments on the file
    share.
    Folders inside each instrument folder
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\SmithLab\\Nikon Microscope #1\\John Smith") indicate
    the name of the researcher who collected the data or the researcher who
    owns the data.  Access control in MyTardis will be determined by the
    user group ("Smith Lab"), whereas the researcher's full name
    will be used to determine the default experiment (dataset grouping) in
    MyTardis.
    Folders inside each full name folder
    (e.g. "D:\\Data\\SmithLab\\Nikon Microscope #1\\John Smith\\Dataset1")
    will be mapped to MyTardis datasets.

**Check For Missing Folders**
  This option provides extra validation of the folder structure.  For example,
  if you choose a folder structure of "Username / Dataset" but you don't have
  any Dataset folders, then when this checkbox is ticked, MyData's settings
  validation will stop and display an error as shown below.

  .. image:: images/CheckForMissingFolders.png

**Experiment (Dataset Grouping)**
  Defines how datasets will be grouped together into experiments in MyTardis.
  Currently, this field is automatically populated when you select a folder
  structure (above), and cannot be modified further.

**User Group Prefix**
  Used with the "User Group / Instrument / Full Name / Dataset"
  folder structure.
  Folders immediately inside the main data directory
  (e.g. "D:\\Data\\SmithLab") are assumed to be MyTardis user groups.
  The actual group name in MyTardis (e.g. "TestFacility-SmithLab")
  may have a prefix (e.g. "TestFacility-") prepended to it.

**Ignore datasets older than**
  MyData is designed to be used for uploading recent data.  If it is configured
  to use an existing data directory containing a large backlog of old data, it
  is advisable to instruct MyData to ignore old datasets so that it focus on
  uploading the recent datasets.

**Max # of upload threads**
  The maximum number of uploads to perform concurrently.  If greater than one,
  MyData will spawn multiple scp (secure copy) processes which (for large
  datafiles) may impact significantly on CPU usage of your system, which could
  affect other applications running alongside MyData.  The default value is 5.


Locking and Unlocking MyData's Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the bottom of MyData's Setting dialog is a Lock/Unlock button, whose label
toggles between "Lock" and "Unlock" depending on whether the Settings dialog's
fields are editable or read-only.  When the Settings dialog's fields are
editable, clicking the "Lock" button will make them read-only, preventing any
further changes to MyData's settings until an administrator has unlocked the
settings.  The locked status will persist after closing and relaunching MyData.

Clicking the "Lock" button displays the confirmation dialog below.

  .. image:: images/LockSettingsConfirmation.PNG

Once MyData's settings are locked, all of the fields in the Settings dialog
will become read-only.

  .. image:: images/SettingsLocked.PNG

Clicking on the "Unlock" button will result in a request for administrator
privileges.

  .. image:: images/UACElevation.PNG

Once administrator privileges have been verified, it will be possible to modify
MyData's settings again.

N.B. This is NOT a security mechanism - it is a mechanism for preventing the
accidental modification of settings in a production workflow.  It does not
prevent advanced users from determining where MyData saves its last used
configuration to disk (e.g.
C:\\Users\\jsmith\\AppData\\Local\\Monash University\\MyData\\MyData.cfg) and
updating the settings outside of MyData.


Saving and Loading Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each time you click OK on the Settings Dialog, your settings are validated, and
then saved automatically to a location within your user home folder, which is
OS-dependent, e.g.
"C:\\Users\\jsmith\\AppData\\Local\\Monash University\\MyData\\MyData.cfg" or
"/Users/jsmith/Library/Application Support/MyData/MyData.cfg".

The settings file is in plain-text file whose format is described here:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html.  An example can be
found here:
`MyDataDemo.cfg <https://github.com/monash-merc/mydata-sample-data/releases/download/v0.1/MyDataDemo.cfg>`_.

Any facilities with potentially malicious users may wish to consider what
happens if a user gets hold of an API key for a facility role account, saved
in a MyData configuration file.  The API key cannot be used in place of a
password to log into MyTardis's web interface, but it can be used with
MyTardis's RESTful API to gain facility manager privileges.  These privileges
would not include deleting data, but for a technically minded user familiar
with RESTful APIs, the API key could potentially be used to modify another
user's data.  Facilities need to decide whether this is an acceptable risk.
Many facilities already use shared accounts on data-collection PCs, so the
risk of one user modifying another user's data subdirectory is already there.

Settings can be saved to an arbitrary location chosen by the user by clicking
Control-s (Windows) or Command-s (Mac OS X) from MyData's Settings dialog,
keeping in mind the risks stated above.  A saved settings file can then be
dragged and dropped onto MyData's settings dialog to import the settings.
This feature is currently used primarily by MyData developers for testing
different configurations.  It is expected that the MyData settings for each
individual instrument PC will remain constant once the initial configuration
is done.
